1. **Black flash when you load the page with dark mode**: This will be fixed soon. We will replace this with a "Loading" screen. (This problem only occurs in light mode. Does anyone even use light mode?)
2. **Buttons on the "Issues" page are awkwardly styled**: A styling error ... it'll be fixed soon too!

If you think you can help fix any of these issues, please check out [Holt Soundboard on GitHub](https://github.com/holt-soundboard/holt-soundboard-web).
