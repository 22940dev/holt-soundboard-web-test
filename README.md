## Mobile app

- iOS (coming soon)

## How it started
There are quite a few Holt Soundboard apps on the Google PlayStore. None of them, however, were good enough for me. For example, none had sounds of Jake Peralta. So I decided to create my own.

October 2018, the Holt Soundboard Version 1 was ready! [Here's the post that started it all](https://www.reddit.com/r/brooklynninenine/comments/9om9cm/new_holt_soundboard_with_sounds_of_other/).

The app was first written in plain HTML/CSS/JS. The code slowly became unusable, to the point that I decided to rewrite the entire app in Angular. Yet again, the code became unusable. So here we have it in VueJS + NuxtJS!

Since then, I've also created a subreddit, [r/holt_soundboard](reddit.com/r/holt_soundboard). It's small, but it's a community!

## Built with
- VueJS
- NuxtJS
- NuxtJS PWA module
